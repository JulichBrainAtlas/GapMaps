Required output path in which all created files are stored in corresponding subdirectories. In addition, the follwing data sets
must be provided:
* GapMapInternal_Atlas_<SIDE>_N10_nlin2Std<REFERENCEBRAIN>_mpm.dat:
      Label file with all mapped cytoarchitectonic areas and GapMaps. This is created with the help of a 3D drawing program 
      for triangular meshes (e.g. MeshLab) from the atlas label file, which contains the MPM of the mapped cytoarchitectonic areas, 
      in which the required boundary lines are drawn, the free areas are filled automatically and then labeled with a suitable GapName name.
* CytoProjectList_<VERSION>.csv: 
      Comma separated csv file with information about the ontology, area names and status. The table must have at least 21 (A-T) columns, 
      with the status in column 17, the internal file name in column 18, the official file name in column 19 and the name used in the 
      Human Brain Project (HBP) in 21.  
* <REFERENCEBRAIN>_fgpmaps_datatable_orig_<SIDE>.dat
      Text file, which indicates for each voxel in the 3D space of the reference brain, with which probability [0.0<pValue<=1.0] 
      which area (id number) is present. It is expectd that this file is stored in the ContourRecon data path.
* conversionlist.txt:
      Text file that indicates to which GapMap an area should belong if the area is still under quality control and has therefore
      not yet been published and should for this reason not yet be available to the public.
